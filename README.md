Arduivis is a bi-directional communication paradigm for programming languages & microcontrollers. The purpose of this project is to explore and expand the interconnectivity possibilities of music, art and science. The general idea revolves around using an Arduino, or a microcontroller with serial capability, as a communication hub. This hub can be programmed to handle with several types of interactions from a selected programming language. Currently, this project is compatible with MaxMSP, Pure Data, Python and NodeJS.
