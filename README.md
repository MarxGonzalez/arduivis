<h3 align="center">a bi-directional communication paradigm for programming languages & microcontrollers</h3>

purpose
========
Create a flexible hardware/software prototyping system to better understand “Big data”

what?
========
The idea revolves around using an Arduino, or similar mircocontroller with serial capability, as a communication hub. Within this hub, a user can send and/or receive data from a microcontroller using a programming language that has serial
capabilities. At this point, anything connected to the microcontroller, that provides some type of data or voltage source, is a new source of information that can be used for new forms of research.

how?
========
- The wiki connected to this respository is where all information regarding the use of arduivis can be found
- <a href="https://vimeopro.com/cskonopka/arduivis">arduivis videos</a>

why?
========
- Because it expands the interconnectivity potential of “Big data” in science, music & art
- This design makes it easier to collect and interpret complex data sets by simplifying the process
- It is a more efficient way to collect data from simultaneous sources
- Increases research potential of unique datasets that may have been previously overlooked
- Cuts down research/development time
