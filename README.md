arduivis
========

arduivis is a bi-directional communication paradigm for programming languages & microcontrollers. The purpose of this project is to explore and expand the interconnectivity possibilities of music, art and science. The general idea revolves around using an Arduino, or a microcontroller with serial capability, as a communication hub. This hub can be programmed to handle with several types of interactions from a selected programming language. Currently, this project is compatible with MaxMSP, Pure Data, Python and NodeJS.

~ what is arduivisJS? ~
arduivisJS is a Javascript factory object that dyanmically creates MaxMSP patches and Arduino code to accomidate the newly created patch. 

~ Why does this matter? ~
- Significantlly cuts down the time it takes to prototype a new idea
- Provides a more efficient way to test experimental systems with external devices in real-time
- Opens the door for new performance possibilities


~ arduivis vs arduivisJS ~



arduivisJS is a project within the idea that specifically deals with dyanamic code/patch creation for MaxMSP and an Arduino.

~ news ~

06/2016: Now that arduivisJS is created the files may be a little messy for a small amount of time so I can reorganize and clean up examples. 

~ known bugs ~

- If you create a template and then cut/paste the objects you won't be able to remove the template using the "Clear" button. To remove it properly, highlight and delete it. Otherwise it works fine.
